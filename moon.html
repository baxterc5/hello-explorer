        <h1>Moon</h1>
        <p>The Moon, Earth's silent companion, is a celestial enigma that has inspired curiosity for millennia. Its cratered face, bathed in silver light, holds the secrets of cosmic collisions and ancient volcanoes. Though lifeless, the Moon’s influence on Earth is profound—it tugs at the oceans, shaping tides and quietly guiding the rhythms of life. As a reflector of sunlight, it transforms the night sky into a canvas of mystery and dreams. Once thought unreachable, it became humanity's first step beyond our world. The Moon reminds us that even in stillness, there is purpose, and in mystery, there is endless inspiration.</p>
